Howdy! 

Welcome to my site. I am Joanna Ortega. In case it wasn't clear by everything on this website, I write. I get paid to write as a technical writer and not so much as a creative writer. Regardless, I love doing both. This site houses my professional history, some samples of my work, and other fun things that might or might not be relevant to you, depending on why you are visiting! 

In my professional life, I work remotely exclusively from Texas. I've worked as a technical writer under different titles since 2019, but it has involved all types of documentation. I am consistently learning new skills and am trying my hand at developing more skills in other areas, such as API documentation. I have experience using several programs, including Articulate, Camtasia, Snag-it, all the Microsoft Office products it seems, Jira, Confluence, etc. The places I work follow Agile methodology, so I am very familiar with these concepts. I've created courses, revised different forms of content, taken notes, and  documented products, policies, and procedures, amogst other things.

I do write creatively and am hoping to publish some day. I am open to writing creatively professionally, and to say that I don't would be slightly dishonest. I simply just don't write fiction at work. I read, I write. I have a dog with very expensive tastes. He, however, does not work although he is smart enough to recognize voices familiar after a few meetings and will therefore provide his own greetings. He's a bit of a personality hire, like me, but unlike me, he does not do documentation work. Or work at all. 

I like what I do. I'm good at what I do. Reach out, tell me what you want, and we can make things work. 

Peruse at your leisure!

P.S. If you don't see a sample of something, feel free to reach out. This site is a work in progress in the midst of an unstable world. I can only prioritize you if I know what you are looking for.
